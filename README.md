Getting and Cleaning Data Final Assignment
==========================================

This project was done for Getting and Cleaning data at Coursera.
The dataset used for the project is from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

The code written for the project, run_analysis.R does these five tasks.

  -Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  -Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  -Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  -Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  -From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for     each activity and each subject.

CodeBook.md contains all the variables, their descriptions and the detailed information on the data transformation.

Output of the run_analsysis.R is saved in xxx.txt
